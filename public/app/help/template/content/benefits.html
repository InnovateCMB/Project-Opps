            <p>As a financial institution, HSBC aims to streamline processes to yield efficiency gains. Prior to developing site, there were multiple channels for employees to learn about new volunteer and job rotation opportunities. These channels include SharePoint sites, User Community sites, email notifications, and bulletin board announcements. With opportunities@HSBC, opportunities can be consolidated into a single, common channel for employees. On a long term basis, maintaining a single channel such as opportunities@HSBC is a sustainable solution that aligns with process efficiency.</p>
