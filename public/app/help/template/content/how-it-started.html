The platform will drive employee engagement, aid in retaining key talent, and increase utilization.

Employees will be able to fill up their under-utilized time when their project work slows down. Alternatively, they can explore what is out there outside of their current roles. Using next generation technology, the tool was designed to match opportunity seekers to opportunity owners based on skill sets and interests.
